## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automatic Text Extraction:** Parse and process meeting transcripts in PDF and other formats.
- **Chunking & Embedding:** Generate vector embeddings using state-of-the-art SentenceTransformer models.
- **Semantic Search:** Retrieve the most relevant content using FAISS vector similarity.
- **Summarization:** Generate concise meeting summaries with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.
- **Secure Storage:** Store files and metadata securely in AWS S3 and DynamoDB.
- **API-Driven Architecture:** Expose functionality via RESTful APIs powered by AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- **Modern Frontend:** Intuitive React-based user interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

1. **File Upload:**
   - Users upload a transcript file via the frontend.
   - A pre-signed S3 URL is generated for secure storage.

2. **Text Extraction:**
   - A Lambda function processes the file to extract and chunk the text.

3. **Embedding:**
   - The chunked text is sent to a Flask server hosted on EC2.
   - SentenceTransformer embeddings are generated and indexed in FAISS.

4. **Retrieval & Summarization:**
   - On query, relevant chunks are retrieved via vector similarity.
   - The context is passed to the Gemini model for summarization.

5. **Storage:**
   - Summaries and metadata are stored in DynamoDB and S3.
